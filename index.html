    <!-- What is food waste? -->
<section class="container">
    <div class="text">
        <h2>What is Food Waste?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="rowitems">
        <div class="container-box">
            <h4>Food waste refers to any food that is discarded, lost, or uneaten, even though it could still be consumed. It includes food that is thrown away from homes, restaurants, grocery stores, and other food-related industries. This waste can come from food that is spoiled, uneaten leftovers, or food that is improperly stored or over-purchased. In many cases, food is discarded even when it is still perfectly safe and nutritious to eat.</h4>
            <br>
            <h2>Types of Food Waste:</h2>
            <h4>
                
                <strong>1) Fruit and Vegetable Waste:</strong> A large proportion of food waste comes from fruits and vegetables. Often, these foods spoil quickly due to improper storage or are discarded because they don‚Äôt meet aesthetic standards (e.g., "ugly" produce). <br>
                
                <strong>2) Beverage Waste:</strong> This category includes unfinished drinks such as juice, milk, and soft drinks that are thrown away due to spillage, expiration, or excess production. Beverages with preservatives can still be wasteful if not consumed within a reasonable time.<br>
                
                <strong>3) Fish, Meat & Poultry Waste:</strong> Fish, meat, and poultry are often wasted because they have a short shelf life, spoil quickly, or are improperly handled during transportation or storage. Additionally, bones, skin, and trimmings are commonly discarded, even though they could be used in broths or other dishes.<br>
                
                <strong>4) Sugar Industry Waste:</strong> In the sugar production process, waste is generated from molasses, sugar beet pulp, and other by-products that are discarded or underutilized, despite their potential to be repurposed as animal feed or in other industries.<br>
                
                <strong>5) Dairy Waste:</strong> Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt are often wasted due to spoilage, especially in households or businesses that purchase in large quantities. Expired dairy is one of the most commonly discarded food categories.<br>
                
                <strong>6) Mineral Waste:</strong> This includes food waste from grains, legumes, and other plant-based sources, particularly the parts that are not consumed, such as husks, shells, or inedible portions of crops.<br>
                
                <strong>7) Oil Residue Waste:</strong> Oil waste arises from the overuse of cooking oils in food preparation or from discarded oil-based products, including frying oil that has been used and is no longer suitable for reuse or consumption.
            </h4>
            
            <br>
            <h4>Food waste is not just a problem for the environment‚Äîit also represents a significant loss of resources such as water, labor, and energy. Furthermore, food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions when it decomposes in landfills, exacerbating climate change. Reducing food waste is a critical goal for both sustainability and food security.</h4>

        <h2>The Food Recovery Hierarchy</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="rowitems">
        <div class="container-box">
            <h4>The **Food Recovery Hierarchy** is a framework provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prioritize strategies for managing excess food. The hierarchy lists methods from the most preferred (at the top) to the least preferred (at the bottom), helping communities, businesses, and individuals determine the most sustainable options for dealing with food waste.</h4>
            
            <h2>Food Recovery Methods: From Most to Least Preferred</h2>
            
            <h4><strong>1) Source Reduction:</strong> The most effective way to prevent food waste is to reduce the overall volume of food produced. This includes efforts to minimize overproduction, improve food storage and handling practices, and reduce portion sizes. It‚Äôs the earliest point of prevention and aims to stop waste before it happens.</h4>

            <h4><strong>2) Feed Hungry People:</strong> Excess food that is safe for consumption should be donated to those in need. Donating food to food banks, shelters, and other community organizations helps address food insecurity while preventing waste. This can include perfectly edible food that would otherwise be discarded.</h4>
            
            <h4><strong>3) Feed Animals:</strong> Another way to reduce food waste is by donating food scraps and surplus food to local farmers for use as animal feed. This is particularly useful for food that may not be suitable for human consumption but is still nutritious for livestock.</h4>
            
            <h4><strong>4) Industrial Uses:</strong> Used fats, oils, and grease (FOG) from food processing or cooking can be repurposed for industrial uses, such as the production of biodiesel fuel. This helps recycle valuable resources and reduce the environmental impact of food waste.</h4>
            
            <h4><strong>5) Composting:</strong> Food waste that cannot be used for the above purposes can be composted. Composting turns food scraps into nutrient-rich organic matter, which can then be used as fertilizer for soil. This is an environmentally friendly way to divert food waste from landfills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</h4>
            
            <h4><strong>6) Landfill/Incineration:</strong> As a last resort, food waste that cannot be repurposed or composted should be sent to a landfill or incinerated. This is the least preferred option due to its environmental impact, as food waste in landfills contributes to methane emissions and pollution.</h4>

            <br>
            <h4>This hierarchy provides a clear, actionable roadmap for addressing food waste. By focusing on prevention and donating surplus food before it becomes waste, we can significantly reduce the environmental and social impact of food waste.</h4>

            <h4>Below is an image illustrating the Food Recovery Hierarchy to help visualize these strategies:</h4>
